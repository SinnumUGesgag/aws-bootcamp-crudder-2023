# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture

1: During Week 0 I spent most of my time trying to get a full understanding of the project and the limitations I would need to work around; I did discover that the project's parent Repo no longer as publically visible instructions, and the journals are now empty, so I would need to find, problem-solve, or watch videos very closely to figure out the code that typically Andrew provided to his students. 

2: I already had a few of the accounts required (i.e. GITHUB, AWS, Lucidcharts, etc)

**LOGICAL DESIGN**

NOTE: The Logical Design was what I came up BEFORE watching Andrews video; I wanted to peice together what I though; it differents in some ways, given how Andrew will eventually guide students through (in future videos) how to use Serverless Caching services; however, I wanted to still show how I had conceptualized a solution to this challenge.

3: I setup an Account for GITPOD & installed AWS CLI

4: Took notes during the Mock-Meeting-Description; I created a Conceptual Design; then later on went back and created a Logical Design

5: Updated my Budgets, Cloudwatch alarms, & SNS

6: I did find some of the material covered in the vidoes to be repeats of information that I extensively covered in some courses I've taken on AWS;
some of it also was a refresh of things I learned in my previous experiences working for an ISP having to navigate a network to troubleshoot or update
hardware, etc. HOWEVER, I powered through to make sure that wasn't anything more for me to learn; typically I did find at least one of two things that I might have 
forgotten, never learned in class, or missed in the past (i.e. some of the material on Security did cover some of the costs & best practices in a more approachable way than some of my previous courses). Additionally, I learned aobut a LOT of free resources out there that I had never heard of.
