__prepped Folder is temporary

In the Tutorial he often references code that they provided to their students for making following along a bit easier; however I do not have access to said code, so I have been watching a video to copy large sets of code that he utilizes then fix/modify them as needed (which has occurred often due to changes I made or has been made to Languages, Tools, plateform of choice, etc) then follow along through the video then troubleshoot (often tripling my workload).

Now I'll instead create new files that are utilized through out the tutorial and prep them here; then (when I go to follow along through the video's instructions) I can modify their prepared scripts and/or move them to where they are needed.

copied code will at times just be formated as .md files ; I'll modify them then troubleshoot them when they are actually needed
